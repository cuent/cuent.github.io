description: I am a Senior AI Reseach Developer at <a href="https://www.heyday.ai/">Heyday</a>, acquired by <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a>, working in Conversational AI and IR ML. I did my masters at Concordia University and McGill University, where I focused on Approximate Bayesian Inference working with count data. I designed models using topic models and mixture models for NLP and healthcare. I've also worked with Semantic Web technologies (<a href="https://redi.cedia.edu.ec/">check out one of my projects</a>). I became a member of the Apache Software Foundation, and I participated in <a href="https://marmotta.apache.org/team-list.html">Apache Marmotta</a>. I did my undergrad in Computer Science in Ecuador at the Universidad de Cuenca.

<!-- My current research interests lie in the interaction of NLP, GRL, and Bayesian Inference. First, NLP offers a bridge so that computers can understand human language and carry the meaning we have collected during years of evolution. Graphs, on the other hand, provide a flexible framework to represent information heterogeneously. Finally, intelligence comes with the ability to understand knowledge. The Bayesian framework is a crucial component for decision-making and quantifying uncertainty. Indeed, other AI subfields (e.g., lifelong learning and meta-learning) can be seen through the Bayesian lens. Yet more powerful, it offers the ability to formulate causal questions. Additionally, since most advances in AI have been due to DL, it cannot go unnoticed. As a result, I am interested in treating these areas through a holistic approach and making these solutions accessible for solving real-life problems, particularly for social science and healthcare, to improve decision-making. -->
