  I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at
  <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/">Imperial College London</a>,
  supervised by <a href="http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/">Yingzhen Li</a>.
  My research focuses on deep generative models. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Senior AI Developer
  at <a href="https://app.heyday.ai/login">Heyday</a> and <a href="https://www.hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a>,
  where I worked on conversational AI, information retrieval, and applied machine learning systems.
  I completed my Master of Applied Science at <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a>
  and <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>, where I focused on approximate Bayesian inference
  for count data modeling.

<!-- My current research interests lie in the interaction of NLP, GRL, and Bayesian Inference. First, NLP offers a bridge so that computers can understand human language and carry the meaning we have collected during years of evolution. Graphs, on the other hand, provide a flexible framework to represent information heterogeneously. Finally, intelligence comes with the ability to understand knowledge. The Bayesian framework is a crucial component for decision-making and quantifying uncertainty. Indeed, other AI subfields (e.g., lifelong learning and meta-learning) can be seen through the Bayesian lens. Yet more powerful, it offers the ability to formulate causal questions. Additionally, since most advances in AI have been due to DL, it cannot go unnoticed. As a result, I am interested in treating these areas through a holistic approach and making these solutions accessible for solving real-life problems, particularly for social science and healthcare, to improve decision-making. -->
