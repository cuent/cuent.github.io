## Introduction

Graphs are everywhere and most knowledge can be modeled with graphs. Graphs can be understood as a complex data structure that can be used as a universal language. Therefore, as any language, graphs communicate ideas using nodes (objects) and edges (interaction); thus any complex system can be modeled by creating relationships between points. We focus in the use machine learning on graphs, but the field of network analysis provide other approaches to analyze, understand and learn from graphs.
