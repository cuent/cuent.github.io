A graphical model is a method for modeling probability distributions under certain uncertainty.

## Toolbox:

1. **Representation:** model uncertainty and encode domain knowledge
2. **Inference:** answer questions $$P(X\mid m)$$, where m is the model or data
3. **Learning:** what model fits my data $$m = \operatorname*{argmax}_{m\in M} F(D,m)$$.

## Benefits:

1. Efficient

    - **(Expensive)** The [chain rule][1] (aka product rule) allows to calculate joint probabilities.
    - **(Cheaper)** Using GM, we can model only those dependencies inferred by the graph, generating fewer parameters; encodes independence.

2. Encode domain knowledge through priors and incorporate them in inference via Bayes theorem.

## GMs vs PGMs:

- GMs use multivariate function.
- PGMs use multivariate distributions.

  ### Structure

  1. Edges represent relationship among the RVs.
  2. Directed nodes represent **causality** while undirected nodes represent **correlation**.

## Bayesian Network and Markov Random Field

### Bayesian Network

![Bayesian Network](/assets/images/bayesian-network.png)

- It is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node has a [Markov blanked][2] (its parents, children and children's parents).
- A node is _conditionally independent_ of the nodes **outside** its Markov Blanket.
- _Joint probability distribution_ is determined by the local conditional probabilities as well as the graph structure.
- Model _can_ be used to generate new data.

### Markov Random Field

![Markov Random Field](/assets/images/markov-random-field.png)

- It is an undirected graph.
- A node is conditionally independent of the other graph nodes, except for its **immediate neighbors**.
- To determine the joint probability distribution, we need to know local contingency functions (_potentials_) as well as structural _cliques_.
- This model _cannot_ explicitly generate new data.
