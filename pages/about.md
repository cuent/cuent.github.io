Coucou tout le monde! I am Xavier, aka cuent or Mr. Smile. Thanks for passing by and I hope you find some interesting content. I am an aspiring AI researcher and as such, I created this blog to document my journey and share from ML, Math, personal notes, and just personal blogs. Hope any of the content is of interest to you. 

I am highly interested in AI and how language works. I speak Spanish, English, and French [and some words in Italian if that counts as speaking… :p]. Also, in applications where AI can help our daily lives and how to spread the word especially to those regions with a lack of experts in the field. My hot keywords are GNNs, NLP, and Bayesian Inference. I am interested in other variety of topics but nowadays, there are too many to explore. Now, I am a Research AI Developer at Heyday.ai where I work in conversational AI and product search. My daily task goes from data preprocessing, reading papers, implementing networks, and thinking out of the box!

Well, who am I? I am a Latino, and originally from the beautiful city of Cuenca, Ecuador. I might be biased but the city is super beautiful with colonial architecture and tons of warm people, lots of charms!! I hold a Bsc. in Computer Science, and in my beginnings, I worked in the interaction of Semantic Web (there my passion for graphs :p) and data mining. BTW, I am a believer that graphs can represent the world and it is such a rich structure that would allow us to extract, represent and understand knowledge. During my early days as a researcher, I was interested in creating potential interaction networks between researchers. I end up creating a framework ([REDI][1]) that extracts information from authors (like Google Scholar) and creates networks, additionally you can get some other information like papers, authors information, etc. The idea was to generate more projects and collaboration between researchers in Ecuador. After some funding, we extended to some countries in Hispanic America. 

Then, I moved to Montreal since at the time, I was working with topic models and clustering techniques. I was interested in more fundamental research. I did my master’s in Montreal, the hub for AI, where I mainly focus on Bayesian Inference under the supervision of Nizar Bouguila and collaborated with professor Yue Li from MILA. On the one side, I was developing new algorithms to do inference using expectation propagation and stochastic expectation propagation. On the other side, with professor Li, I worked analyzing and developing a new Topic Model for heterogeneous health records. I learned tons and while reading the literature I saw an emerging field known as GRL thanks to one of my professors William Hamilton. This sparked into me some eagerness for the field.

At the time, I attend reading groups once a week for GRL and NLP to be in the cycle of new research and continue the habit of reading papers constantly. I also like reading groups because it allows me to talk with other peers and thus improve my communication skills. 

As a note aside, parallel to my education and research, I love open source, and I have been part of many editions of Google Summer of code either as a student or mentor. I am a member of the Apache Software Foundation. I try to improve my coding skills constantly. Now, I have been looking into PyTorch Lightening as one of my side projects to contribute.

As a person in real life, I am charismatic and a bit introverted. I love to smile. I love running and CrossFit. I am a competitive runner, follow me on [Strava][2] or challenge me on a route. In general, I love the outdoors, I come from the mountains and as a matter of fact, I love hiking and biking. I love reading, writing, and cooking. As being English, my second language, I created this blog also intending to improve my writing and be comfortable communicating my thoughts.
