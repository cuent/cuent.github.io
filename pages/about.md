I am a master's student at Concordia University. My research focuses on Bayesian inference and topic modeling. I have been always passionate about sharing the small things that I learn. I created this website aiming to share my journey into Machine Learning and hoping that somebody out there can benefit from it.

I have also worked for a while with Semantic Web technologies (check out one of the projects [here](https://redi.cedia.edu.ec/)). So, you can imagine that I am interested in Semantic Web and Knowledge Graphs. I am a member of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), and I participate in the project [Apache Marmotta](http://marmotta.apache.org/) as a committer.

Even though my main research is not deep learning or the trendy stuff, I have been curious about it and I have been learning on my own. Thus, lately, I am interested in the intersection of machine learning and graph representation learning.
