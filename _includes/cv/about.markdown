Hola, welcome to my blog! 

I am an AI Research Developer at Heyday.ai, previously I was a master's student working on Bayesian inference and topic modeling. I have been always passionate about sharing. I created this website aiming to share my journey into ML and hoping that someone out there can benefit from the content.

Apart from ML, I've worked for a while with Semantic Web technologies ([check out one of my projects][1]). I am interested in Semantic Web and Knowledge Graphs. I am a member of the [Apache Software Foundation][2], and I participate in the project [Apache Marmotta][3] as a committer.

I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, graph representation learning, and Bayesian reasoning.
